### Test Plan for TodoMVC Application
This document outlines the test plan for the TodoMVC application. 
The plan covers the testing strategy for each component of the application, including the Header, Main, Footer, Input, and Item components.

## Header Component

>>Types of Tests:

> Unit Tests: Test individual functions and event handlers.
> Integration Tests: Ensure correct integration with other components.

>> Test Cases:

> Rendering:
Test if the component renders without crashing. This includes checking if the header and the input field are present in the document.

> Dispatch Function:
Test if the ADD_ITEM action is dispatched with the correct payload when the Enter key is pressed in the input field.

## Main Component

>> Types of Tests:
> Unit Tests: Test individual functions.
> Integration Tests: Ensure correct integration with other components.

>> Test Cases:

> Rendering:
Test if the component renders without crashing. This includes checking if the main section and the todo items are present in the document.

> Toggle All Checkbox:
Test if the TOGGLE_ALL action is dispatched when the "Toggle All" checkbox is clicked. Also, test if the checkbox status updates based on visible todos.

>Todo Items Render Test: 
Test if the correct number of todo items are rendered based on the todos prop. Also, test if individual todo items are rendered correctly.

>Visibility Filter Test: 
Test if the visibility filter works correctly. This includes testing if the correct todo items are shown based on the current route (/, /active, /completed).
>Writable State Test:
 Test if the component changes to a writable state when the label is double-clicked.

## Input Component

>> Types of Tests:

>Unit Tests: Test individual functions and event handlers.

>> Test Cases:

> Rendering:
Verify that the input component renders correctly.

> Props Test:
Test if the component renders with the provided props. This includes checking if the input field has the correct placeholder, label, and default value.

> Submit Test:
Test if the component sanitizes the input value and submits it when the Enter key is pressed. This includes checking if the onSubmit callback is called with the sanitized input value.

> Reset Test:
Test if the component resets the input value after submit. This includes checking if the input value is empty after the Enter key is pressed.

> Whitespace Test:
Test if the component does not call the onSubmit callback for whitespace input. This includes checking if the onSubmit callback is not called when the input value is whitespace and the Enter key is pressed.

> Minimum Length Test:
Test if the component does not submit if the input value does not meet the minimum length. This includes checking if the onSubmit callback is not called when the input value is less than the minimum length and the Enter key is pressed.

> Blur Test:
Test if the component calls the onBlur callback when the input loses focus. This includes checking if the onBlur callback is called when the input field loses focus.

## Item Component

Types of Tests:
Unit Tests: Test individual functions and event handlers.

>> Test Cases:

> Rendering:
Verify that the item component renders correctly.

> Toggle Test:
Test if the component toggles the completed state when the checkbox is clicked. This includes checking if the dispatch function is called with the correct action type and payload.

> Remove Test:
Test if the component removes the item when the delete button is clicked. This includes checking if the dispatch function is called with the correct action type and payload.

>  Edit Mode Test:
Test if the component enters and exits the edit mode correctly. This includes checking if the todo item has the correct class when it is double-clicked and when it loses focus.

> Update Test:
Test if the component updates the item title when the edit is submitted. This includes checking if the dispatch function is called with the correct action type and payload when the input value is changed and it loses focus.

> Empty Value Test:
Test if the component does not update the item title when the edit is submitted with an empty value. This includes checking if the dispatch function is called with the correct action type and payload when the input value is empty and it loses focus.

## Footer Component

>> Types of Tests:
Unit Tests: Test individual functions and event handlers.
Integration Tests: Ensure correct integration with other components.

>> Test Cases:

> Rendering:
Test if the component renders without crashing. This includes checking if the footer, filter links, and the "Clear completed" button are present in the document.

> Navigation Test:
Test if the component navigates to the correct route when a filter link is clicked. This includes checking if the window location hash updates correctly.

>Action Dispatch Test:
Test if the REMOVE_COMPLETED_ITEMS action is dispatched when the "Clear completed" button is clicked. This includes checking if the dispatch function is called with the correct action type.

> Button State Test:
Test if the "Clear completed" button is disabled when there are no completed todos. This includes checking if the button is disabled in the document.

>Active Todos Count Test
Test if the component displays the correct number of active todos. This includes checking if the correct text ("0 items left!", "1 item left!", "2 items left!", etc.) is present in the document.

>No Todos Test
Test if the component does not render when there are no todos. This includes checking if the footer is not present in the document.

# General Testing Considerations:
>> Edge Cases:
Test with empty inputs, edge cases for input validation, etc.
>> Mocking:
Mock external dependencies such as dispatch functions.

# Coverage:
Aim for high code coverage to ensure comprehensive testing.
By following this test plan, we can ensure thorough testing coverage for the TodoMVC application, helping to identify and fix any issues or bugs before deployment.
